## Introduction

The award-winning OpenFPGA framework is the **first open-source FPGA IP generator** supporting highly-customizable homogeneous FPGA architectures. OpenFPGA provides complete EDA support for customized FPGAs, including Verilog-to-bitstream generation and self-testing verification. OpenFPGA opens the door to democratizing FPGA technology and EDA techniques with agile prototyping approaches and constantly evolving EDA tools for chip designers and researchers.

**If this is your first time working with OpenFPGA, we strongly **recommend you watch the** [introduction video about OpenFPGA](https://youtu.be/ocODUGcYGqo)**

A quick overview of OpenFPGA tools can be found [**here**](https://openfpga.readthedocs.io/en/master/tutorials/getting_started/tools/).
We also recommend potential users check out the summary of [**technical capabilities**](https://openfpga.readthedocs.io/en/master/overview/tech_highlights/#) before compiling.

## Compilation

**A tutorial **video about **how to compile** can be** found [here](https://youtu.be/F9sMRmDewM0)**

Detailed guidelines are available at [**compilation guidelines**](https://openfpga.readthedocs.io/en/master/tutorials/getting_started/compile/).
Before starting, we strongly recommend you read the required dependencies and ensure that they are correctly installed.
It also includes detailed information about the docker image.

## Documentation

OpenFPGA's [full documentation](https://openfpga.readthedocs.io/en/master/) includes tutorials, descriptions of the design flow, and tool options.

## Tutorials

You can find a set of [tutorials](https://openfpga.readthedocs.io/en/master/tutorials/), with which you get familiar with the tool and use OpenFPGA for various purposes.

## Backward Compatibility

If you were using an old version of OpenFPGA and are now interested to move to the latest version, please check out the [developer guidelines](https://openfpga.readthedocs.io/en/master/dev_manual/back_compatibile).
